Pomodroid is a Java/Android application that interacts with a Trac 
system, retrieves developer’s tasks and lets him work following the 
basic rules of the Pomodoro technique. Pomodroid focuses on basic 
features of the technique. It does not focus on advanced techniques,
such as the prediction of the number of Pomodoros needed for an activity.

Initial reading
===============

Pomodroid is for any Android device using Android >= 1.6.
It has been tested on a Nexus One phone. The source code contains all
the needed dependencies, which are:
 * Android-xmlrpc (http://code.google.com/p/android-xmlrpc/), modified 
   to suits our needs
 * Db40 (http://db4o.com), used instead of SQLite, for playing with an
   object-oriented database

Trac
===============

Right now it is only possible to download issues from a single Trac
system that _must_ have/use:
 * XML-RPC plugin (http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin) installed
 * HTTP BASIC AUTH access (may either be on HTTP or HTTPS) on /xmlrpc
   location
   
Project Status
===============
Pomodroid has been developed for the Advanced Internet Technologies 
course at the Free University Of Bolzano by Daniel Graziotin and 
Thomas Schievenin. We decided to release it under the GPLv3 license 
and host the code on Github. Everybody is free to contribute and join
the project.
The original project also included modules for metrics gathering and
sending to a Unibz metric system using XML-RPC. 
The system is called Prom. We are actually cleaning the code the remove
every Prom reference. In any case, no metrics are actually sent. 
Look at the code if you don’t trust us :) If you just see any reference 
to Prom in the program, just ignore it. It will be cleaned up.
The metrics are actually gathered and stored in the database, 
but there are no operations on them. 
We are planning to reuse these metrics to build 
some nice statistics for the user.
